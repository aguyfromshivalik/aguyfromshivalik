Hey! I am Ajay, a PhD student in University of Hyderabad. </br>
I am trained in theoretical chemistry (No! I am not that regular white lab coat chemistry guy). </br>
I code, read anything (not everything 😉) interesting, and try to experience life.</br>
I get excited when I learn something new, read something interesting, or debug my code.</br>

   - 👷‍♂️ **What I am working on?** </br>
     * _Implementation of OpenMP in reaction dynamics code._
     * _Fitting 3D potential energy surface (PES) using Neural network._
       
   - 📖 **What I am reading?**
      * _War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy_

The tools I have used:
* _Fortran (for scientific programming)_
*  _Python (mostly as a side language to help with data)_
*  _Bash shell scripting (mostly for automatization)_
* _TensorFlow + Keras (to write simple Feed forward neural network)_
* _Jupyter Notebook_
* _MATLAB (for building and training neural network)_
* _LaTex_
